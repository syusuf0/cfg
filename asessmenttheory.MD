##  1.1 SDLC represents the Software Development Life Cycle. Its main goal is to generate a high-quality software that ensures to satisfies and surpass client’s expectations and within the given budget and time frames.

## 1.2	 In python it will generate a ZeroDivisionError. Since trying to operate a dividing a number by zero – arithmetic exception.

## 1.3	‘git push’

## 1.4	NULL – shows when the database has a data value that is unknown or missing.

## 1.5	2 responsibilities are:
## 3a) Monitoring the team adheres to the principles, procedures, and practises of Scrum. This entails leading Scrum meetings and educating the team about Scrum.
## 3b) Eliminating obstacles or assisting the team in eliminating obstacles by identifying the appropriate persons.

## 1.6. Brute force: This approach requires going line by line over the code, times when testing each line individually or in segments, to verify the performance and locate from which things begin to appear incorrect

## Use when: Whenever other methods were unsuccessful yet you are uncertain of the  root of the issue at hand, brute force is the final resort. This often happens in lesser, fewer complicated code bases and tends to be the ultimate option.

## Print Debugging: A print statement is inserted to the code with the goal to display specific values or signals while the programme is being debugged or traced. This approach is typically used when we have a good idea of where the issue might be.

## 1.7. Since a comparison operation (>=) is implemented, that doesn't exist for all types, the method can_pay(price, cash_given) would return an error if not numerical values were given as inputs. Performing a check for the input parameter types and raising an error if not numerical types are present would be the required exception handling in this case.

## 1.8. Git's branching feature permits developers to construct a distinct development line that is separate from the primary line of code. This is helpful when creating new features or testing code. The "master" branch of the primary line of code can be re-joined once the branch's code has reached a stable state.

## 1.9 Creating an ordering system for a restaurant:
   ## a) Key Requirements:
Users should have access to the menu, have the ability to select items and add them to carts, be able to put in orders obtain confirmations, and be given access to the orders so that staff members can view and handle them.
   ## b) Important factors and issues:
        The system that is used must meet the following requirements: - It must be simple to use for everyone involved - It has to be safe, especially for the handling of payments - It must be dependable and quick because orders must be handled instantly
   ## b) Potential parts or equipment
        Customers place orders using a frontend interface (website or app), also an interface for staff to check and handle orders. Order processing and payment are handled by a backend server.
Database to store data of the menu and order
