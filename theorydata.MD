CFG SECTION 1:

1.	Strategic Data Interpretation: Data scientists bridge the gap between raw data and actionable insights to aid strategic decision-making.
Data scientists solve problems technically and strategically by managing the full data pipeline, from collection and cleaning through modelling and interpretation.

1.2 Outlier Definition
a. Definition: An outlier is a data point significantly deviating from the majority of data in a dataset.

b. Examples: In a test where most students score between 80 and 100, a score of 21 or 132 would be considered an outlier.

c. Outliers Removal: Outliers should not always be removed as they can sometimes contain valuable insights. Their removal or retention should depend on the research question and context.

d. Other Dataset Issues: Incomplete data, class imbalances, multicollinearity, and skewed distributions are other common dataset issues.

1.3  Data Quality and Cleaning
a. Data Cleaning Definition: Data cleaning improves dataset quality by correcting or removing faulty records.

b. Cleaning data is crucial since dirty data can lead to inaccurate analytics and conclusions. It ensures data quality, consistency, and usability.

c. Common Mistakes: Missing values, duplicate entries, and inconsistent formatting are common dataset issues.

1.4  Unsupervised Learning - Clustering a. Definition: Clustering in unsupervised learning involves grouping data points into "clusters" or subsets based on similarity, without any prior labeling.

b. Use: Exploratory data analysis uses it to find patterns and groupings.

c. Real-world Application: Retail market categorization is common.

d. Limitations: Finding the optimal number of clusters and finding non-existent patterns are major issues.


1.5 a. Definition: Supervised learning classifies new data points using a labelled dataset to train a model.

b. Use: When the outcome variable or label is categorical.

c. Email spam screening is a typical application.

Data and Processing Needed: Labelled data is essential. Common preprocessing steps include feature selection and normalisation.
